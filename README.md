collection of learning material that i have personally used (*am using*) for the Rust
programming language.

## introduction

order matters, so follow the steps in order.

1. speed-run [**The Book**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

it does not matter if you do not understand everything, the objective is to get
a general idea of the language. just **skim through the book**. if anything catches
your attention, **note it down** so you can come back to it later. just please **do not try hard**, as it is not needed.

> **ALTERNATIVE**: if you prefer video tutorials (like me), you can watch
[**The Rust Lang Book**](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLai5B987bZ9CoVR-QEIN9foz4QCJ0H2Y8&si=KqXUYv074Uc_nH_i)
YouTube playlist by the *Let's Get Rusty* channel.
this playlist is essentially the same content as the book, but in video format. **perhaps**
this approach is even **faster**.

2. solve [**Rustlings**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)

this should be one of your first approaches to writing Rust code; it is a set of
exercises that will help getting familiar with the language.
the exercises get increasingly harder, but **nothing that one cannot handle**.
i suggest completing them **all at your own pace**, it does not matter if one day you only manage to solve one exercise, or if you solve them all in one day.
